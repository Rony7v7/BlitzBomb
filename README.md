# Blitz Bomb: Kevin's Challenge

Welcome to Blitz Bomb, where you take on the role of Kevin in a strategic race against time to activate all the bombs! Your mission is to navigate the map efficiently, activating each bomb while avoiding unnecessary detours.

## **How to Play:**

### **Movement**
Control Kevin's movements using the WASD keys. Plan your path wisely to cover all the bombs before time runs out.

### **Power Up - Dijkstra's Insight**
Kevin has a special power-up - Dijkstra's Insight. This allows you to find the shortest path between two points on the map. To activate it, follow these steps:

1. Locate the Dijkstra button on the right side of the screen.
2. Click the button to enable Dijkstra's Insight.
3. Click on two points on the map to reveal the shortest path between them.

Use this power-up strategically to optimize your route and reach the bombs more efficiently.

## **Tips:**
- **Plan Ahead:** Take a moment to assess the map before making your move. Identify the optimal route to cover all the bombs.
  
- **Dijkstra's Insight:** Make the most of the Dijkstra power-up to find shortcuts and save time. Activate it when facing complex maps or when you need to optimize your path.

- **Avoid Repetition:** Kevin should traverse each node only once. Be mindful of your path to maximize efficiency and complete the challenge.

- **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the timer! Move swiftly but strategically to ensure you activate all bombs before time runs out.

- **Master the Map:** With practice, you'll learn to navigate the maps more efficiently, optimizing your path and achieving higher scores.

## **Objective:**
Activate all the bombs by traversing the shortest path possible. Challenge yourself to improve your strategy and beat your own record!

Are you ready, Kevin? The clock is ticking, and the bombs await activation. Good luck!
