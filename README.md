Welcome to Blitz Bomb, where you take on the role of Kevin in a strategic race against time to activate all the bombs! Your mission is to navigate the map efficiently, activating each bomb while avoiding unnecessary detours.

## HOW TO PLAY:

Blitz bomb is a strategy game. You play as kevin and your goal is to activate all the bombs (Pass over them) before you run out of time. 
In order to do this you should take the shortes path to traverse all the bombs and try to avoid repeting the same nodes in your path.

#### Movement
You can move with WASD.

#### Power Up - Dijkstra

Kevin has a special power-up - Dijkstra's Insight. This allows you to find the shortest path between two points on the map. To activate it, follow these steps:

Locate the Dijkstra button on the right side of the screen.
Click the button to enable Dijkstra's Insight.
Click on two points on the map to reveal the shortest path between them.
Use this power-up strategically to optimize your route and reach the bombs more efficiently.
